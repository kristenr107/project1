 <p> Bad Bunny was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico as Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio in 1994. He knew he wanted to be a singer since he was 5 years old and has been dedicated to his goal since. He lists his biggest influences as Daddy Yankee, Héctor Lavoe, Marc Anthony, and Vico C. He began making music in his free time from his job as a supermarket packer. He started uploading his music to SoundCloud in 2017, and it took off quickly. Within the year he was making songs with the world's biggest stars such as Drake, Diplo, and Daddy Yankee. Now he is one of the hottest stars in latin music, he has won two Latin Grammys, one MTV VMA, and has been nominated for six Grammys. Releasing two albums in 2020, he was the most listened-to act in the world on both Spotify and YouTube for the year. His music style is a mix of R&B, pop, reggaeton, latin soul, and rap. He likes to push the envelope with his songs and videos. He is signed to Rimas Entertainment LLC. As of today he has collaborated with almost all of the biggest names in latin music and many international stars. His career has taken off only a few years in and there's no telling where he could go.<br>
